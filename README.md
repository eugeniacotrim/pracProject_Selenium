I have automated the lazy loading testing on Amazonâ€™s web application using Selenium.

On Eclipse, I created a package with 3 classes:
- LibAmazon class
The browser is initiated, and two methods are created to: open the web app (starting the browser and connecting to the URL page) and perform the search for iPhone 13 and open up the page with all the search results.

- AmazonEcomm class
Class with the main method to call and execute the methods described in the LibAmazon class.

- POMRepo class
Repository with all of the string variables and locators.
